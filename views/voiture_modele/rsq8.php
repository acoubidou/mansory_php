    $strParagraphe = "Following the presentation of the MANSORY complete conversion of an Audi RS6 in March 
                    this year - MANSORY's debut for Audi - MANSORY is expanding its portfolio for the Audi 
                    brand to include the class of high-performance luxury SUVs and is presenting a complete 
                    conversion based on an Audi RSQ8.
                    Based on the great success and inspired by the constantly increasing demand for the MANSORY 
                    Audi RS6, the complete conversion of the RSQ8 follows the principles and style of the RS6 
                    complete conversion. From now on, the sport-oriented MANSORY customers can choose between 
                    two vehicle types from Audi, depending on their personal needs: A high-performance estate 
                    car and a high-performance luxury SUV.
                    As with the RS6 station wagon, several body parts and modifications on the RSQ8 are also 
                    made of high-quality carbon. Thus, in addition to the modified front and side skirts, the 
                    rear skirt of the car is also finished in visible carbon. The bonnet itself is an 
                    eye-catcher - and as usual with MANSORY - completely made of carbon. All carbon components 
                    are manufactured in the company's own autoclaves and implemented in a unique production 
                    quality, which only MANSORY engineers and designers are able to realise in the highest 
                    quality thanks to their years of experience.
                    In combination with the deep black paint finish and the red decorative stripes that begin 
                    at the front edge of the bonnet and run across the entire vehicle, the numerous MANSORY 
                    conversions on the entire exterior powerfully and elegantly emphasise the design language 
                    of the RSQ8 and give the car a harmonious overall appearance that attracts attention like 
                    magic.
                    Thanks to these extensive changes to the bodywork and the resulting improved aerodynamic 
                    and downforce, the MANSORY engineers created the perfect  basis for a massive performance 
                    increase of the biturbo V8 engine.";
